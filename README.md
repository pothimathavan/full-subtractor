# full-subtractor
A Full Subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction of three binary bits:  A (minuend)  B (subtrahend)  Bin (borrow input)  It produces two outputs:  Diff → Difference of inputs  Bout → Borrow output  This project implements a Full Subtractor in Verilog HDL with a testbench and simulation script (run.do) for QuestaSim.
